    Braille is a tactile writing system used by the blind and the visually impaired. It
    is traditionally written with embossed paper.

    Braille characters are small rectangular blocks called cells that contain tiny palpable bumps
    called raised dots. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from
    another.

    We will use 6-dots Braille alphabet.
    Each letter can be represented as a matrix 3x2, where 1 is raised dot and 0 is an empty.

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="alphabet" src="{{MEDIA}}alphabet.svg" alt="alphabet"
         width="700px"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="alphabet" src="{{MEDIA}}alphabet.svg" alt="alphabet"
         width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Letters should be separated be empty column. Whitespace is two empty columns
    (plus separator empty columns if it between letters).
    Various formatting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them.
    They have no direct equivalent in print. The most important in English Braille are:
    "capital" and "number".

<p>
    We will use several basic punctuation symbols:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="punctuation" src="{{MEDIA}}punctuation.svg" alt="punctuation"
         width="650px"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="punctuation" src="{{MEDIA}}punctuation.svg" alt="punctuation"
         width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    You are given a text. And you should convert it in Braille page.
    The page contains contains one or several lines and represented as a matrix.
    Each line contains no more than 10 symbols (including non-printed).
    Lines are separated by one empty row.
    Symbols are separated by empty columns but there are no separators in begginings and ends of lines.
    If text can be placed in one line, then page width are proportional by text length.
    If page has more than one line, then width are maximal and the final line is appended by whitespaces.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The page as a list of lists or tuple of tuples with integers (1/0).
